##Project Origin

Last Year I bought an intersting iOS application named ACG ART[APP Store link](https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/acg-art-er-ci-yuan-dong-man/id577006740?mt=8).

<!-- more -->

As you can see, it will provide large number of anime pictures. It's really briliant.

But you know mobile phone it's not a work platform , it is hard to manage and pick the image from the application.(Connection and download are not fast..)
So, I spent two days worktout this little thing to batch download.




##WoW~ I can't stop it!
